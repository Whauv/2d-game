# HISTORIC GAME
                                                                                     
	Entertainment is one of the most important aspects of one's life. 
    Therefore we intend to create such a game that would be entertaining and informative. 
    Games nowadays fill nothing but a child's addiction and at such a young age when children are easily influenceable, everyone must know about the glorious and proud history of     our great nation. 
    Our game will be based on multiple historic warriors who gave their life and soul fighting for their creed and their birthplace. 
    This game will be a 2D side scroller made with the help of languages like C, C++, Java, HTML, and additional software like unity and game maker studio 2. 
    All of us in our group will learn how to use the above-mentioned languages and while also studying basic animation to portray some cutscenes. 
  	In this game, we will follow multiple characters and see their story which is portrayed only in books. 
    Visual media can be easier to digest and fun to follow along, with this game we will bring light to many legends the world might have forgotten. 
    We hope to create a game that will do justice to our gallant heroes and will be enjoyable at the same time.
